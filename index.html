        <h2>A little bit about me...</h2>
        <div id="textContainer">
            <p id="textArea">Thank you for visiting my website! I am Logan Dolence, a passionate and dedicated musical theatre performer. With a BFA in Musical Theatre from Western Michigan University, I have honed my skills in acting, singing, dancing, and choreography. 

                One of my recent accomplishments was being a part of the World Premiere of the brand new musical, His Story the Musical. I originated the role of Joseph, showcasing my ability to bring a character to life on stage. Additionally, I have worked with Cedar Point Live Entertainment, Casa Mañana, and Gateway Playhouse, among others. You can find a detailed list of my credits on my resumé.
                
                What drives me in this industry is my belief in the power of the arts. In a world filled with division and brokenness, the arts have the ability to teach, heal, and foster growth. I find it remarkable how the arts can create a sense of community and share that with the world. Through my work, I strive to create that sense of community, provide room for growth, and make a positive impact.
                
                The mission of my website is to showcase my talent and promote myself as a musical theatre performer. By providing a platform for future employers to see my work and credits, I hope to open doors for exciting opportunities in the industry.
                
                What sets me apart from others are my exceptional organizational skills, focused work ethic, and excellent time management. These qualities allow me to stay on top of my commitments and deliver high-quality performances. Additionally, my heart and passion for the arts shine through in my work, creating a unique and captivating presence on stage.
                
                In my experience working at an amusement park, I faced the challenge of performing the same show multiple times a week. It was easy to fall into autopilot mode and lose the excitement and energy. To overcome this, I relied on my co-workers. We made the workday fun by watching funny videos before shows, telling jokes, and uplifting each other on stage through eye contact. These small actions helped me maintain a fresh sense of excitement and renewed energy every day.
                
                I invite you to explore my website, where you can find my headshot, resumé, and reels. If you have any further questions or would like to discuss potential opportunities, please don't hesitate to contact me. Thank you again for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
